# Introduction 

As of 06-04-2020,  more than
1,133,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported across the world, with more than 62,000
deaths [@whositrep]. This weekly report presents forecasts of the
*reported* number of deaths
in the week ahead and analysis of case reporting trends (case
ascertainment) for 42 countries with active transmission.

The accuracy of these forecasts vary with the quality of surveillance
and reporting in each country. We use the reported number of deaths due to
COVID-19 to make these short-term forecasts as these are likely more
reliable and stable over time than reported cases. In countries with
poor reporting of deaths, these forecasts will likely represent an
under-estimate while the forecasts for countries with few deaths might
be unreliable.  Our estimates of transmissibility reflect
the epidemiological situation at the time of the infection of COVID-19
fatalities. Therefore, the impact of controls on estimated
transmissibility will be quantifiable with a delay between
transmission and death.

## Projections

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.

## Temporal trend in the ratio of deaths to reported cases

Starting in March, we compute the average and 95% CI for the ratio of
deaths  to reported cases (with a 10-day delay) using a moving window
of 7 days.

# Methods

We define a country to have active transmission if
at least ten deaths were observed in the country in the last two
consecutive weeks. We intend to produce forecasts every
week, for the week ahead. Ensemble forecasts are produced from the
outputs of three different models. We assume a gamma
distributed serial interval with mean 6.48 days
and standard deviation of 3.83 days following [@wang2020strongly].


## Model 1

The approach estimates the current
reproduction number (the average number of secondary cases generated
by a typical infected individual, $R_t$) and to use that to forecast
future incidence of death. The current reproduction number is
estimated assuming constant transmissibility during a chosen
time-window (here, one week).


**Estimating current transmissibility**

Here we relied on a well-established and simple method
[@nouvellet2018simple] that assumed the daily incidence, I~t~ (here
representing deaths), could be approximated with a Poisson process
following the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating]:

$$I_t \sim Pois\left( R_t \sum_{s=0}^tI_{t-s}w_s\right)$$

where $R_t$ is the instantaneous reproduction number and $w$ is the
serial interval distribution. From this a likelihood of the data given
a set of model parameters can be calculated, as well the posterior
distribution of $R_t$ given previous observations of incidence and
knowledge of the serial interval [@cori2013new]. 


We used this approach to estimate $R_t$ over three alternative
time-windows defined by assuming a constant $R_t$ for either the 2, 3
or 4 weeks prior to the most recent data-point. We made no assumptions
regarding the epidemiological situation and transmissibility prior to
each time-window. Therefore, no data prior to the time-window were
used to estimate $R_t$, and instead we jointly estimated $R_t$ as well as
back-calculated the incidence before the time-window. Specifically, we
jointly estimated the $R_t$ and the incidence level 100 days before the
time-widow. Past incidence was then calculated using the known
relationship between the serial interval, growth rate and reproduction
number. The joint posterior distribution of $R_t$ and the early
epidemic curve (from which forecasts will be generated) were inferred
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.


The model has
the advantage of being robust to changes in reporting before the
time-window used for inference.

**Forward projections**

We used the renewal equation [@fraser2007estimating] to project the incidence
forward, given a back-calculated early incidence curve, an estimated
reproduction number, and the observed incidence over the calibration
period. We sampled sets of back-calculated early incidence curves
and reproduction numbers from the posterior distribution obtained in
the estimation process. For each of these sets, we simulated
stochastic realisations of the renewal equation from the end of the
calibration period leading to projected incidence trajectories. 


Projections were made on a 7-day horizon. 
The transmissibility is assumed to remain constant over this time
period. 
If transmissibility were to decrease as a result of control interventions
and/or changes in behaviour over this time period, we would predict 
fewer deaths; similarly, if transmissibility were to increase
over this time period, we would predict more deaths We
limited our projection to 7 days only as assuming constant
transmissibility over longer time horizons seemed unrealistic in light
of the different interventions implemented by different countries and
potential voluntary behaviour changes.


## Model 2

**Estimating current transmissibility**

The standard approach to inferring the effective reproduction number at
$t$, $R_t$, from an incidence curve (with cases at t denoted I~t~) is
provided by [@cori2013new]. This method assumes that
$R_t$ is constant over a window back in time of size *k* units (e.g. days
or weeks) and uses the part of the incidence curve contained in this
window to estimate $R_t$. However, estimates of $R_t$ can depend strongly on
the width of the time-window used for estimation. Thus
mis-specified time-windows can bias our inference. In [@parag2019optimising]
we use information theory to extend the approach of Cori et al. to optimise
the choice of the time-window and refine estimates of $R_t$. 
Specifically:

-   We integrate over the entire posterior distribution of $R_t$, to
    obtain the posterior predictive distribution of incidence at time
    t+1 as P(I~t+1~ \| I~1~^t^) with I~1~^t^ as the incidence curve up
    to t. For a gamma posterior distribution over $R_t$ this is analytic and negative
    binomial ([see @parag2019optimising] for exact formulae). 
	
-   We compute this distribution sequentially and causally across the
    existing incidence curve and then evaluate every observed case-count
    according to this posterior predictive distribution. For example at
    t = 5, we pick the true incidence value I~5~\* and evaluate the
    probability of seeing this value under the predictive distribution
    i.e. P(I~5~ = I~5~\* \| I~1~^4^).

This allows us to construct the accumulated predictive error (APE) under
some window length *k* and under a given generation time distribution
as:

$$\text{AP}E_{k} = \sum_{t = 0}^{T - 1}{- \log{P\left( I_{t + 1} = I_{t + 1}^{*}\  \right|\ I_{t - k + 1}^{t})\ \ }}$$

The optimal window length *k\** is then
$k^{*} = \arg{\min_{k}{\text{AP}E_{k}}}$.  Here
*T* is the last time point in the existing incidence curve.

**Forward Projections**

Forward projections are made assuming that the transmissibility
remains unchanged over the projection horizon and same as the transmissibility
in the last time-window.  The projections are made using the standard
branching process model using a Poisson offspring distribution.
