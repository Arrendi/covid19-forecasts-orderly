# Introduction {.nav .nav-tabs .tab-content}

As of 06-04-2020,  more than
1,133,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported across the world, with more than 62,000
deaths [@whositrep]. This weekly report presents forecasts of the
*reported* number of deaths
in the week ahead and analysis of case reporting trends (case
ascertainment) for 42 countries with active transmission.

The accuracy of these forecasts vary with the quality of surveillance
and reporting in each country. We use the reported number of deaths due to
COVID-19 to make these short-term forecasts as these are likely more
reliable and stable over time than reported cases. In countries with
poor reporting of deaths, these forecasts will likely represent an
under-estimate while the forecasts for countries with few deaths might
be unreliable.  Our estimates of transmissibility reflect
the epidemiological situation at the time of the infection of COVID-19
fatalities. Therefore, the impact of controls on estimated
transmissibility will be quantifiable with a delay between
transmission and death.

## Projections and $R_t$ estimates {.nav .nav-tabs} 

### Ensemble Model {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills} 

#### Methods

This is an unweighted ensemble of Models 1, 2 and 3. We obtained
posterior distribution for all estimated reproduction numbers and
forecasted deaths by simply combining the posterior distributions of
each model.

Ensemble models, even if built with a relatively simple approach such
as adopted here, have been shown to typically
perform better than individual models in the context of epidemiology
of infectious diseases [@viboud2018rapidd].


#### Projections

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.

*Figure 2*: Reported daily deaths, current and past forecasts based on
the ensemble model.
For each country with active transmission (see methods), we plot
the observed incidence of deaths (black dots). 
Past forecasts, where available, are shown in green (median and
95% CrI), while latest forecasts are shown in red (median and
95% CrI). Vertical
dashed lines show the start and end of each week (Monday to Sunday).

transmissibility estimated from each method as well as the ensemble
estimates.

#### Summary of results

**Table 1**: Observed
(where available) and forecasted weekly death counts and the estimated
levels of transmissibility from the ensemble model for each country
with active transmission
(see Methods) and for each period for which forecasts were
produced. The number of deaths has been rounded to 3 significant figures.

### Temporal trend in the ratio of deaths to reported cases

Starting in March, we compute the average and 95% CI for the ratio of
deaths  to reported cases (with a 10-day delay) using a moving window
of 7 days.

```
*Figure 11*: Temporal trends in the ratio of reported
deaths to reported cases 10 days prior (medians and 95% CIs, solid
lines and bands respectively).
Also plotted are the reported deaths (red dots) and reported cases
(black dots). 
The reported number of deaths and cases have
been re-scaled so
that the maximum recorded numbers of deaths or cases (with a 10-day
delay) reaches 1.

*Note that if deaths exceed the number of reported cases 10 days
before, we set the ratio at 1 (95% CI 1-1)*

### Estimating ascertainment



**Table 4**: Results summary for reporting and case ascertainment. We present 
(**i**) the estimated ratio of deaths to reported cases 10 days prior per country
  (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14 days*; (**ii**) the estimated
  case ascertainment per country (mean and 95% CI) during the last *14
  days*; (**iii**) the estimated factor to be multiplied by observed
  number of cases to obtain
  the true number of cases (scaling factor x observed cases). Mean and
  95% CI, estimated for the last *14 days*; (**iv**) the observed and
  predicted number of cases in the *last week* (week starting
  22-03-2020). Estimates for the number of deaths have been rounded to 
  3 significant figures. Estimated case ascertainment, factors to real
  size and predicted true number of cases assume perfect reporting of
  deaths.
