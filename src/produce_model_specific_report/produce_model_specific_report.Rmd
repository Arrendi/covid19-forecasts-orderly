## Detailed Summary

### Objectives and caveats

The **main** objective in this report is to produce forecasts of the 
number of deaths in the week ahead for each country with active
transmission.

* We define a country as having active transmission if
at least *ten* deaths were observed in the country in each of the past
two weeks. In the analysis for week beginning 
29-03-2020, 22 countries/regions were included in the
analysis. For the week beginning 05-04-2020,
the number of countries/regions included based on these thresholds is 42.


* We forecast the number of potential deaths as the reporting of deaths
is likely to be more reliable and stable over time than the reporting 
of cases. 

* As we are forecasting deaths, the latest estimates of
transmissibility reflect the epidemiological situation at the time of
the infection of COVID-19 fatalities. Therefore, the impact of
controls on estimated transmissibility will be quantifiable with a
delay between transmission and death.


A **secondary** objective of this report is to analyse case
ascertainment per country. As well as forecasting ahead, we use the number
of reported deaths and of cases reported with a delay (delay from reporting to deaths,
see Case Ascertainment method) to analyse the reporting trends per
country. If the reporting of cases and deaths were perfect, and
the delay between reporting and death is known, the ratio of
deaths to delayed cases would equal the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR).

In this analysis, key assumptions are:

* The mean underlying CFR is 1.38% (95% Credible Interval (1.23 - 1.53)) [@verity2020],
* The delay from a case being reported to death follows a gamma distribution with mean 10 days, and standard deviation 2 days.
* All deaths due to COVID-19 have been reported in each country.

## Methods


The serial interval estimates observed from various studies thus far
may be biased toward lower values due to observation bias whereby, in
contact tracing studies, long serial
intervals tend to be under-represented. To account for this, as a
sensitivity analysis, we also use a
shorter serial interval of mean 4.80 days and standard deviation of
2.70 days [@ferguson2020report]. Results using this shorter interval
are presented in the section Sensitivity Analyses. While using  a
longer serial interval has very little
impact on the weekly forecasts produced, it results in much higher
estimates of transmissibility.


```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}

short <- EpiEstim::discr_si(0:30, 4.8, 2.7)
long <- EpiEstim::discr_si(0:30, 6.48, 3.83)
df <- data.frame(
    x = c(0:30, 0:30),
    cat = c(rep("short", 31), rep("long", 31)),
    val = c(short, long)
)

        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 20),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 20)
    ) +

    scale_fill_manual(
        values = c(short = "#b067a3", long = "#9c954d"),
        breaks = c("short", "long"),
        labels = c("Short SI (mean 4.80, sd 2.70)",
                   "Long SI (mean 6.48, sd 3.83)")
        )
    
```
*Figure 1* Serial Interval distributions used in the analysis. Here
the serial interval relates to death and characterise the time between
the deaths of an infector their infectee. Our main analysis assumes a gamma
distribution with a mean of 6.48 days and a standard deviation of 3.83
days (shown in green). The shorter serial interval, used for
sensitivity analysis, with a mean of 4.80 days and a standard
deviation of 2.70 days is shown in purple.

**Current and past forecasts**

*Caution note*: We note that in France, a large increase 
in deaths was reported towards the end of the week starting 30-03-2020. This 
is largely due to back-reporting of deaths outside hospital settings, 
and therefore, this is likely to have inflated the estimates
$R_t$. The forecasts of deaths for the coming week are thefore likely
to be over-estimated.
